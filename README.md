# DarkSideCalc

DarkSideCalc is a sample calculator implemented using Python 3 and with a [PyQt6](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt6/introduction.html) GUI. DarkSideCalc implements basic math operations, including division, multiplication, addition, and subtraction.

DarkSideCalc is intended to be a demonstrative example of how to build a Python + PyQt6 GUI application using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.

## TODO

- Implement a back-end + front-end for the app to further learn how API's work.


## Requirements

For DarkSideCalc to work, you need to have [Python](https://www.python.org) >= 3.6.1. Then you need to install the PyQt6 library. You can do this by using `pip` in a Python virtual environment:

```console
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ python -m pip install pyqt6
```

After these commands have finished, you can run DarkSideCalc as described in the next section.

## How to Run DarkSideCalc

To run DarkSideCalc from your system's command line or terminal, execute the following command:

```console
$ python darksidecalc.py
```

After running this command, you'll get DarkSideCalc running on your machine.

## How to Use DarkSideCalc

To use DarkSideCalc, just enter a valid math expression using your mouse and then press `Enter` or click the `=` button to get the result:
